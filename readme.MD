#Library Management System:
Design a library management system using classes such as Library, Book, and Member.
Implement features like adding books, borrowing and returning books, and tracking member information.
Use inheritance and encapsulation to model relationships between different entities in the system.

##the library class 
is also the parent class, this means that all other classes
will inherit at least one method from thr parent class

##addBook method
is used to add a new book to the lsit of books
through the library class by using the append() function.
it returns a new list of books with the new book added at the end
of the list

##removeBook method
is used to remove a book from the lsit of books
through the library class by using the remove() function.
it returns a new list of books without the book that was removed
